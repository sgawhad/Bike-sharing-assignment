## General Information
- This project provides an application for a Bike sharing company which is a bike-sharing system service in which bikes are made available    for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free 
- Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
- This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- The aim is to understand and identify various factors affecting the customer users in the system and how to use available data to gain more customers
- Dataset used for this project is day.csv, data for all users for year 2018-2019 is available.
